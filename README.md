*My Reflection

- This project helped me understand the basics of tailwind css.
- It showed me how to utilise the mobile first responsive design styling for layouts and certain effects.
- I liked how instead of having to write new classes or elements for divs and certaain elements in order to access them in the css file, you can just add the styles you need and have same time output of what you are doing.
- I also liked how short the syntax was for the properties, as you follow along with the cheatsheet you get to easily remember to the syntax and as you go along you implement without looking it up.
- I had challenges with a few things when I worked on the project such as fixing the space on the right of my container. I also had to do alot of research and trail and error to fix the padding inside and placing the container of the information inside the footer in the center when the screen is large.
- After doing more reading I managed to fix the space on the right of my container by adding margin for the x-axis to auto for when the screen size is extra large, this helped to place the container in the middle of the footer.
- I also had to do alot of reading to remember which elements need the aria label and which one don't have the accessibility feature with aria labels.

- In overall this project boosted my knowledge in CSS by utilising tailwind css as I get to test different styling very easy and quickly.
